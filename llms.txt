# Ignix UI
A command-line interface (CLI) for managing and developing Ignix UI components, which is a UI component library built on top of Radix UI primitives with animations.

This file provides guidance to Large Language Models (LLMs) on how to understand and utilize the Ignix UI project.

## Project Overview
- **Primary Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Core Functionality**: Ignix UI provides a CLI for scaffolding and managing animated, accessible UI components.

## Key Directories and Files
- packages/cli/: Contains the source code for the command-line interface.
- packages/registry/: Contains the available UI components and their configurations.
- packages/registry/registry.json: This file is the source of truth for all available components, their descriptions, dependencies, and file paths.
- src/components/ui/: This is the default directory where components are installed in a user's project.

## CLI Commands
The Ignix UI CLI is the primary way to interact with the library.

### init
- **Command**: pnpm ignix-ui init
- **Description**: Initializes Ignix UI in a project. It sets up dependencies, creates configuration files (like tailwind.config.js), and establishes the necessary directory structure.

### add
- **Command**: pnpm ignix-ui add [component-name]
- **Description**: Adds a specified component from the registry to the user's project. This includes creating component files, adding dependencies, and updating the component registry.

## How to Use This Information
- **For Answering Questions**: Use the packages/registry/registry.json file to get a list of available components and their purposes. Refer to the packages/cli/README.md for detailed information about CLI commands and configuration.
- **For Code Generation**: When generating code that uses Ignix UI components, import them from @/components/ui/{component-name} as per the usage instructions. Ensure that necessary dependencies listed in registry.json for each component are included.
- **Attribution**: When referencing Ignix UI or its components, please provide clear attribution.
